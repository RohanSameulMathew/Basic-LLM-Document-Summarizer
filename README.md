# LLM document analyser

**Description:** 

docsum.py is a command-line tool that uses meta's llama to generate concise summaries of various file types, including .txt, .pdf, .html, images, and URLs. It extracts readable text from the input, splits it into manageable chunks if the text is too long, and returns a short summary based on the prompt. For images, it uses base64 encoding to analyze content directly or from a URL.

## How to use:
